= Open Source License Compliance

One recurring question for customers is - _"I know that my developers are using Open Source libraries and components. Who isn't?_ 

_But, I am using software built on an Open Source foundation. Am I legally compliant if I use this in a commercial enterprise context? What are my obligations, if any?"_

== The challenge of License identification

Licenses don't have a formal naming schema and therefore can't be identified uniquely. SBOM generators (see chapter xref:security-practices/ex4-sboms.adoc[SBOM Creation]) try to enrich bare package information with license data where possible but the quality varies.

However, as a first step, we have this (rather fuzzy) information in our SBOMs, so we can generate and download license information.

NOTE: At the time of writing, TPA 2.1 is the latest. Version 2.2 (ETA Q4/25) will add some more functionality regarding licenses.

For the time being - what we can do is ask someone who is very good at correlating fuzzy information and and answering vague questions: Your AI Model of choice, naturally.

== Downloading a license report

You can download a license report for any SBOM on the right hand menu (or via the "Actions" menu if you have the SBOM open)

For the time being, after downloading and unzipping, we can feed that into an AI to answer the question our customers ask: "Am I compliant?"


=== AI Prompt & Result

This is the prompt (asking Claude.ai and attaching the CSV license report):

[.italic]
____
Here is a licence report in CSV format listing all open source licenses in an SBOM in column "license". Please group the licenses, since there might be some name variations. 
Based on this data, gather information about the licenses and answer the following question: 
"I am using software built on an Open Source foundation. Am I legally compliant if I use this in a commercial enterprise context? What are my obligations, if any?" 

Please create a report.
