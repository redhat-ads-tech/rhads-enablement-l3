= Exercises

After all the theory, here are some exercises that look at key tooling for a secure software supply chain:

Above is an example of what a CI/CD chain could look like if we added security guardrails and tools in the various stages of the process.

In the table below you find where we are using the `cli` tools and what product they belong to / work with:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Tool |Description

a|`cosign`

image::security-practices/supplychain-cosign.png[Where is cosign?, link=self,  window="image"]

|*[Trusted Artifact Signer]* A tool for container signing, verification, and storage in an OCI registry. It allows you to sign and verify container images and other artifacts, storing signatures and signed attestations alongside the artifacts themselves. Cosign integrates with Trusted Artifact Signer's/Sigstore's keyless signing infrastructure.

a|`gitsign`

image::security-practices/supplychain-gitsign.png[Where is gitsign?, link=self,  window="image"]

|*[Trusted Artifact Signer]* A tool that enables keyless signing of Git commits using Trusted Artifact Signer/Sigstore. It replaces the traditional GPG-based commit signing workflow with a more automated approach using ephemeral keys and OIDC authentication, with signatures stored in Rekor's transparency log.

ðŸ‘ˆ _Where is it?_
a|`ec`

image::security-practices/supplychain-ec.png[Where is ec?, link=self,  window="image"]

|*[Trusted Artifact Signer]* A command-line tool for Conforma (formerly Enterprise Contract) that securely verifies supply chain artifacts and enforces policies about how they were built and tested. It provides a manageable, scalable, and declarative way to ensure container images and other artifacts meet security and compliance requirements.
 
ðŸ‘ˆ _Where is it?_
a|`syft`

image::security-practices/supplychain-syft.png[Where is syft?, link=self,  window="image"]

|*[Trusted Profile Analyzer]* A tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from container images, filesystems, and archives. It catalogs all packages, libraries, and dependencies found in various formats, supporting output in SPDX, CycloneDX, and Syft's native format. Syft integrates with vulnerability scanning workflows and supply chain security tooling.
 
ðŸ‘ˆ _Where is it?_
a|`roxctl`

image::security-practices/supplychain-roxctl.png[Where is roxctl?, link=self,  window="image"]

|*[Advanced Cluster Security]* A command-line interface for Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) / StackRox that manages Kubernetes security operations. It allows you to check deployments against security policies, scan images for vulnerabilities, manage security policies, and interact with the RHACS platform for runtime security monitoring and compliance enforcement. Furthermore, since ACS version 4.7, it can also generate SBOMs of container images.

== Preparation 

In these exercises, we will interact with {quay_url}[Quay] (as the Container Registry) and {gitlab_url}[GitLab] (to host our signed code artifacts). We will also have to deploy a Terminal Pod that can run podman (and has all necessary tools installed, similar to what we're using in the chapter xref:setup-tas/setup-openshift.adoc[Setup Trusted Artifact Signer on OpenShift] )

=== "Podman Terminal"

Let's quickly deploy the Podman-capable terminal, so we can use that going forward. 

Open the {openshift_console_url}/terminal[OpenShift terminal^,window="terminal"] and login as `{openshift_admin_user}` with `{openshift_admin_password}`

Then, clone the following repository and execute the terminal deployment:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-tssc-tmm/l3-enablement-helpers.git
cd l3-enablement-helpers/security-concepts
./deploy-podman-terminal.sh 
----

You should now have a new terminal https://admin-terminal-ttyd.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[here^,window="terminal"] that we will be using going forward, since it has all the tools and configuration already installed.

a|In this Lab environment, *Trusted Artifact Signer* and *OpenShift* use the same Keycloak Realm (in case you were wondering why it says "TRUSTED-ARTIFACT-SIGNER" when you login to OpenShift).

2+|*PLEASE LOG OUT OF THE {openshift_console_url}[OPENSHIFT CONSOLE^,window="console"] NOW* 

2+|If you're still logged in as `admin`, the image signing, code commit signing and attestation steps below will *_automatically use the `admin` user_* since you already have an open session (with the console). 

You won't be able to sign with `user1` / `{rhdh_user_password}`.

It's ok to sign with `admin` but we want to avoid the impression that signing is an admin task - as long as you have an OIDC Identity, you can sign. 

Also, all the ready-made examples that you can copy & paste use `user1`.

=== Quay Registry

To avoid interfering with other exercises, let's quickly create a new organisation in Quay, that we'll be using for our exercises:

Since we're now in a new terminal session, we need to clone our helper scripts again:

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
git clone https://github.com/redhat-tssc-tmm/l3-enablement-helpers.git
cd l3-enablement-helpers/security-concepts
./create-quay-org.sh
----

[source,console]

================================

=== GitLab Repository

Since we'll be pushing code commits to GitLab in this lab, let's also quickly create a new organisation and repository. We also have a script for that:

In the same `l3-enablement-helpers/security-concepts` directory, we have a script `create-gitlab-project.sh` that does this, so we don't have to do it manually via the GitLab UI.


[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]

./create-gitlab-project.sh
