= Orchestrator for {product_rhdh_name}

Other modules demonstrate how to use Software Templates as a means for developers to scaffold new codebases that follow organisational standards, and self-servce certain aspects of their daily activities. 

However, developer self-service requests might require more than what a Software Template can provide natively. For example, certain activities require an approval step, or involve long-running stateful processes - this is where the Orchestrator for {product_rhdh_name} can help. 

The Orchestrator feature provides extends {product_rhdh_name} with support for workflows created using https://sonataflow.org/[SonataFlow^].

## SonataFlow and Serverless Workflow

_SonataFlow is a tool for building cloud-native workflow applications. You can use it to do the services and events orchestration and choreography_ - https://kie.apache.org/docs/components/sonataflow/[Apache KIE^]

SonataFlow is part of a broader ecosystem of projects within Apache KIE, including Drools, jBPM, and Kogito. Specifically SonataFlow is an implementation of the https://serverlessworkflow.io/[Serverless Workflow^] model. Serverless Workflow is a cloud-native workflow engine which allows teams to design, deploy and execute arbitrarily complex workflows which can integrate with external systems through several mechanisms. Teams define workflows in the Serverless Workflow format, and SonataFlow will take care of the build and serverless deployment aspects for you.

The following workflow definition demonstrates functions, input validation using schema(s), and behaviour modeling using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine[state machine^] semantics. A workflow like this can be built and deployed on OpenShift as a Quarkus-based application using the SonataFlow Operator.

## SonataFlow and Orhestrator

The Orchestrator feature effectively acts as an interface between {product_rhdh_name} and SonataFlow-powered workflows. Workflows can integrate with the https://backstage.io/docs/notifications/[Backstage Notifications^] plugin, which allows users or groups to be notified of milestones in the workflow execution. 

The following screenshot shows the prior "greeting" workflow available in the {product_rhdh_name} UI.

## Conclusion

In summary the Orchestrator feature for {product_rhdh_name} enables teams to create stateful workflows using open standards, and provide them in a self-service manner through their internal developer portal.
