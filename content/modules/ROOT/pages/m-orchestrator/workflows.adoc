= Developing, Managing, and Running Workflows

In this section you'll learn how to:

* Develop a workflow on OpenShift or Kubernetes using the SonataFlow development profile.
* Deploy workflows on OpenShift via Helm using a pre-built example.
* Run a workflow using Orchestrator in {product_rhdh_name}.

## Developing Workflows on OpenShift

It's impractical to cover all aspects of development for SonataFlow and Serverless Workflow in this module, however you'll get hands on with a basic example that demonstrates a basic Operator-based development flow. After this, you'll learn how to make the workflow available in {product_rhdh_name}.

### Create a Workflow in Dev Mode

. Visit the *tssc-dh* project in the OpenShift Web Console.
. Click the plus (*+*) icon in the top navigation, and choose *Import YAML*.
. Paste the following YAML and click create:
+ 
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: sonataflow.org/v1alpha08
kind: SonataFlow
metadata:
  namespace: {ns_tssc_rhdh}
  name: greeting
  annotations:
    # Setting the profile to dev mode allows us to run the underlying
    # Quarkus server in dev mode - meaning we can use the dev UI to
    # test and debug the workflow
    sonataflow.org/profile: dev
    sonataflow.org/description: Greeting example on OpenShift!
    sonataflow.org/version: 0.0.1
spec:
  flow:
    start: ChooseOnLanguage
    functions:
      - name: greetFunction
        type: custom
        operation: sysout
    states:
      - name: ChooseOnLanguage
        type: switch
        dataConditions:
          - condition: "${ .language == \"English\" }"
            transition: GreetInEnglish
          - condition: "${ .language == \"Spanish\" }"
            transition: GreetInSpanish
        defaultCondition: GreetInEnglish
      - name: GreetInEnglish
        type: inject
        data:
          greeting: "Hello from JSON Workflow, "
        transition: GreetPerson
      - name: GreetInSpanish
        type: inject
        data:
          greeting: "Saludos desde JSON Workflow, "
        transition: GreetPerson
      - name: GreetPerson
        type: operation
        actions:
          - name: greetAction
            functionRef:
              refName: greetFunction
              arguments:
                message:  ".greeting+.name"
        end: true
----
. A new *SonataFlow* resource will appear in the Topology View. Click it and wait for the Pod to enter the *Running* status.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/sonataflow-pod-running.png[]
. Click the arrow next to the Pod on the Topology view, then visit the `/q/dev-ui` endpoint to view the https://quarkus.io/guides/dev-ui[Quarkus Dev UI]. Alternatively, https://greeting-tssc-dh.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/q/dev-ui[this link^] also works.
+
NOTE: Quakus is the application framework that exposes REST endpoints, performs validation, and even provides extensions such as `sysout` in our sample workflow. The Serverless Logic Operator uses https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.kie.kogito/kogito-codegen[kogito-codegen^] to generate Java code from your workflow definition and JSON schemas.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/sonataflow-q-dev-ui.png[]

An important part of the *SonataFlow* workflow CR you deployed is the `sonataflow.org/profile` annotation that's set to `dev`. This annotation instructs the Serverless Logic Operator to start the Quarkus application (that's hosting the workflow) in development mode. That's why the Quarkus Dev UI is available.

### Experimenting with the Quarkus Dev UI

Use the Quarkus Dev UI to test a workflow.

. Click the *Workflows* link inside the *Serverless Workflows Tools* box. Workflows will be listed.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/quarkus-devui-workflows.png[]
. Click the play button under the *Actions* column for the *greeting*.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/quarkus-devui-start-workflow.png[]
. Enter the following JSON in the *Start Workflow Data*, then click *Start*:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
{ "language": "English"}
----
. Return to the workflows screen. Your workflow run will be listed.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/quarkus-devui-workflow-run.png[]
. Click the *greeting* link. The workflow run details are listed, showing that that the English branch was executed. 
+
image::orchestrator-overview/quarkus-devui-workflow-outline.png[]
. Scroll down and you'll see that "Hello from JSON Workflow" is in the outputs.

### Edit the Workflow

. Return to the OpenShift Web Console, and return to the {ns_tssc_rhdh} project's Topology view.
. Edit the greeting *SonataFlow* by clicking the three dots on the *SF* item in the Topology view.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/quarkus-devui-edit-sf.png[]
. Switch to the YAML editor.
. Update one the Spanish entry in `ChooseOnLanguage` conditions to check for "Irish" and change the `transition` to "GreetInIrish"
. Find the corresponding `GreetInSpanish` state and change it to `GreetInIrish`.
. Additionally, change the `data.greeting` to `Háigh ó JSON workflow,`
+ 
image::orchestrator-overview/quarkus-devui-edit-workflow.png[]
. Scroll down and click *Save*.
. Next, visit the Pod logs of the *greeting* Pod. Notice that it restarts Quarkus? You should see the Quarkus logo printed - indicating a restart of the framework.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/quarkus-devui-restarts.png[]

Test the workflow again, but pass the "Irish" as the language and observe the results.

## Integrate a Workflow with Orchestrator

When it's time to deploy a production-ready workflow, you need to build it into a container image and run it using the `gitops` profile. This is outlined in the https://sonataflow.org/serverlessworkflow/main/cloud/operator/gitops-profile.html[SonataFlow Deployment Profiles Guide^]. In this section you'll use a pre-built image to save time.

### Install a Production-Ready Workflow

To start, delete the development version of the *greeting* workflow:

. Open the OpenShift Web Console, and return to the *{ns_tssc_rhdh}* project's Topology view.
. Delete the greeting *SonataFlow* by clicking the three dots on the *SF* item in the Topology view, then clicking *Delete SonataFlow*.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/sonataflow-greeting-delete.png[]

Next, use the OpenShift Web Terminal to deploy the production version of the greeting workflow:

. Click the Web Terminal (*>_*) icon in the top navigation of the OpenShift Web Console.
. Launch a terminal in the popup using the default settings. Once the terminal starts, run these commands:
+
* Set the current project context to *{ns_tssc_rhdh}*:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
oc project {ns_tssc_rhdh}
----
* Add a Helm repository that contains sample workflows:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
helm repo add workflows https://redhat-ads-tech.github.io/orchestrator-workflows/
----
* Install the greeting workflow:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
helm install greeting-workflow workflows/greeting -n {ns_tssc_rhdh}
----
. The new *greeting* service will appear in the Topology view.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/sonataflow-helm-install.png[]
. Additionally, if you login to {product_rhdh_name} you'll now see that *Greeting workflow* is listed.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/rhdh-workflow-list.png[]

NOTE: If the greeting workflow doesn't appear in the {product_rhdh_name} UI, delete the Pod to force a refresh of the workflows. Failing that, check the logs and verify the Pods are all healthy.

### Run the Workflow

. Click the play button on the workflow in {product_rhdh_name}.
. Select a language when prompted.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/sonataflow-rhdh-params.png[]
. Click *Next*, verify the parameters then click *Run*.
. A page showing workflow details will be shown. This includes the resulting *Greeting Message* determined by your chosen language.
+
image::orchestrator-overview/sonataflow-rhdh-complete.png[]

This is a very simple workflow example, but it demonstrates how SonataFlow-based workflows are integrated with {product_rhdh_name} using the Orchestrator feature. 

If you're wondering how the parameters screen was generated, you can see the https://github.com/redhat-ads-tech/orchestrator-workflows/blob/main/charts/greeting/templates/sonataflow.greeting.yaml#L18-L20[`dataInputSchema` referenced here^], and the https://github.com/redhat-ads-tech/orchestrator-workflows/blob/main/charts/greeting/templates/cm.greeting-resources-schemas.yaml#L12[JSONSchema file(s)^] in the same directory. 

Additionally, this production-ready workflow is run in the https://github.com/redhat-ads-tech/orchestrator-workflows/blob/main/charts/greeting/templates/sonataflow.greeting.yaml#L7[`gitops` profile^] and is https://github.com/redhat-ads-tech/orchestrator-workflows/blob/main/charts/greeting/templates/sonataflow.greeting.yaml#L78[deploying by a pre-built container image^] per the SonataFlow best-practices referenced earlier.
