= Workflows with State and Integrations

Now you will implement a stateful use case for developer self-service using the Orchestrator: requesting a namespace on an OpenShift cluster. The namespace has limited resources, defined by https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/[resource quota^] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/limit-range/[limit ranges^]. In our case, the namespaces come in two sizes, small and large.

To illustrate the possibilities of the Orchestrator plugin, when a developer requests a large namespace in an OpenShift cluster the namespace requires approval.

== Understanding the Workflow

The serverless workflow used in this section is stored in https://github.com/redhat-ads-tech/orchestrator-self-service-workflows[redhat-ads-tech/orchestrator-self-service-workflows on GitHub^]. The repository structure is as follows:

* *create-ocp-namespace-swt*: Contains the workflow definition and dependencies (API specifications and JSON schemas)
* *scripts*: Files used to build the production-ready workflow container image and generate deployment manifests.
* *charts*: The Helm Chart used to deploy the workflow. The templates with a numeric prefix are autogenerated
* *resources*: Contains a Dockerfile used to build the workflow container image

Additionally, GitHub Actions is used to to build and release new versions of the container image and Helm Chart whenever the version number in the *pom.xml* in *create-ocp-namespace-swt/* folder is updated.

=== Serverless Workflow: Functions

View the https://github.com/redhat-ads-tech/orchestrator-self-service-workflows/blob/main/create-ocp-namespace-swt/src/main/resources/create-ocp-namespace-swt.sw.yaml[serverless workflow file: create-ocp-namespace-swt.sw.yaml^]. You can see that it defines a set of *functions* upfront. These functions are used to:

* Interact with GitLab Issues using the GitLab REST API (note references to the _specs/gitlab-openapi.yaml_)
* Run Software Templates and send notifications to {product_rhdh_name} users (again via REST endpoints defined in _specs/notifications-openapi.yaml_)
* Evaluate results and perform data transformation using https://jqlang.org/[jq expressions^] for the final workflow output (note the use of a `result.message` that matches the *workflow-output-schema.json* structure).

=== Serverless Workflow: States

As mentioned earlier, a serverless workflow is a set of states and rules for transitioning between them - a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine[Finite State Machine^].

Following the *functions* a set of *states* are defined, including a `start.stateName` that references the `NamespaceSizeSwitch`. This switch determines whether the workflow transitions into the `LaunchSoftwareTemplate` or `GetGitlabProjectId` state, based on the provided namespace size - large namespaces trigger the GitLab approvals flow.

Assuming the user requested a *large* namespace, the first state transition is to *GetGitLabProjectId*. This state calls the *getProjectId* function declared in the *functions* block.

```yaml
- name: GetGitlabProjectId
  actionMode: sequential
  actions:
    - name: GetGitlabProjectId
      actionDataFilter:
        toStateData: .getProjectIdResult
        useResults: true
      functionRef:
        arguments:
          search: orchestrator-approvals
          simple: true
        invoke: sync
        refName: getProjectId
  transition:
    nextState: CreateIssue
```

The `actionDataFilter` instructs the workflow to update the overall workflow state (`useResults: true`), and store the result of the *getProjectId* call under a `getProjectIdResult` property. 

The workflow then transitions to the *CreateIssue* state and reads the project ID from the the `getProjectIdResult` and creates an issue that can be used to approve or deny the creation of the large workspace.

After the issue is created, the workflow will continuously transition between the the *PollIssue* and *CheckIssueStatus* states until an approved or denied label is found in the issue's labels. The *PollIssue* state sleeps for a *Period* of *Time* before running - specifically *60 seconds* as represented by `PT60S`.

=== Serverless Workflow: Output

When an end state is reached, e.g *CloseIssueDenied*, it declares this fact using the `end.terminate: true` property.

```yaml
- name: CloseIssueDenied
  type: operation
  actionMode: sequential
  actions:
    - actionDataFilter:
        useResults: true
      functionRef:
        invoke: sync
        refName: errorDeniedResult
      name: setOutput
    - actionDataFilter:
        toStateData: .closeIssueResult
        useResults: true
      functionRef:
        arguments:
          id: .getProjectIdResult[0].id|tostring
          issue_iid: .createIssueResult.iid
          state_event: close
        invoke: sync
        refName: closeIssue
      name: CloseIssue
  end:
    terminate: true
  metadata:
    errorMessage: '"Creation of namespace " + .namespace + " denied"'
```

Additionally, this state uses *functionRef* to invoke one of the `expression` functions defined earlier. For example, assume `errorDeniedResult` is invoked. This will set the `result` to "Creation of namespace <the namespace name> denied" and attach the link to the associated GitLab Issue by placing it in the `outputs` of the workflow output. 

== Configure {product_rhdh_name} for the Advanced Workflow

The advanced workflow will use the notification plugin to keep users updated on the execution of their namespace request. Make sure the plugin is enabled.

=== Enable Notifications

. Visit the *{ns_tssc_rhdh}* namespace in the OpenShift Web Console.
. Open the YAML editor for the *tssc-developer-hub-dynamic-plugins* ConfigMap, and verify that the notification plugins are enabled.
. If they're missing or disabled make sure to update the ConfigMap to add them like so:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
- disabled: false
  package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-notifications
- disabled: false
  package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-plugin-notifications-backend-dynamic
- disabled: false
----
. Scroll down and click *Save*.

=== Enable Token-Based API Access

Backstage, and therefore {product_rhdh_name} supports https://backstage.io/docs/auth/service-to-service-auth/#static-tokens[token-based API access^]. Update the {product_rhdh_name} configuration to enable this feature.

. Open the YAML editor for the *tssc-developer-hub-app-config* ConfigMap.
. Update the `backend.auth` section to enable `externalAccess` - do not replace or remove existing properties in the `backend` object:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
backend:
  auth:
    externalAccess:
      - type: static
        options:
          token: ${BACKEND_SECRET}
          subject: Orchestrator
----
. Scroll down and click *Save*.

The `BACKEND_SECRET` environment variable being referenced is already used as a session signing secret. In a production scenario you should add a new environment variable by mountain a Secret with a securely generated token, e.g using the `openssl` CLI:

```bash
openssl rand 24 | base64 | cut -c1-32
```

For now, the `BACKEND_SECRET` is fine.

== Import Software Templates for Developer Self Service

In the previous section you learned that the workflow that will launch a software template to create the namespace for the developer. 

Before deploying the workflow itself, you need to import the software template that it will use to create namespaces.

. Login to {product_rhdh_name} as the *{openshift_admin_user}* user using the passowrd `{openshift_admin_password}`.
. Click the self-service icon (the *+* plus) in the top-right corner of the UI.
. Click the *Import an existing Git repository* button.
. Enter the following URL in the *Select URL* field and click *Analyze*:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
https://github.com/redhat-ads-tech/orchestrator-self-service-templates/blob/main/namespace/template.yaml
----
. You'll be asked to review the entities being imported, as shown:
+
image:orchestrator-overview/rhdh-register-template.png[Registering Software Templates]
+
. Click *Import* when prompted.
. Select the self-service icon (the *+* plus) icon on the top navigation bar, then filter by setting the *Tags* to `orchestrator` to see the new template.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/rhdh-developer-self-service-templates.png[Developer Self Service Software Templates]

The software template to create a namespace is not meant to be used directly, but rather through an Orchestrator Workflow. While it is visible (and usable) it should be hidden using RBAC rules in production.

The *OpenShift Namespace Request* software template is annotated with the `backstage.io/managed-by: orchestrator` annotation, as can be seen in the https://github.com/redhat-ads-tech/orchestrator-self-service/blob/main/namespace/template.yaml[template file in GitHub^]. Additionally the template has an `orchestrator` tag that can be used to find it more easily in the self-service list, as seen in the previous screenshot.

=== Deploy the Serverless Workflow

As a reminder, workflows are deployed using the *SonataFlow* Custom Resource. You'll use a Helm Chart to deploy the various resources associated with this advanced workflow.

. Return to the OpenShift Web Console and open a Web Terminal.
. Enter the following commands:
+
* Set the current project context to *{ns_tssc_rhdh}*:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
oc project {ns_tssc_rhdh}
----
* Add the Helm repository that contains the advanced self-service workflows:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
helm repo add advanced-workflows https://redhat-ads-tech.github.io/orchestrator-self-service-workflows/
----
* Define pre-requisite authentication tokens first:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
export BACKSTAGE_TOKEN=$(oc get secret tssc-developer-hub-env -n tssc-dh -o jsonpath='{.data.BACKEND_SECRET}' | base64 -d)
export GITLAB_TOKEN=$(oc get secret root-user-personal-token -n gitlab -o jsonpath='{.data.token}' | base64 -d)
----
* Install the namespace request workflow, making passing the tokens and URLs to your {product_rhdh_name} and GitLab instances:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
helm install request-ns advanced-workflows/create-ocp-namespace-swt -n {ns_tssc_rhdh} \
--set env.backstageBackendUrl="https://backstage-developer-hub-{ns_tssc_rhdh}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}" \
--set env.backstageBackendBearerToken="$BACKSTAGE_TOKEN" \
--set env.gitlabUrl="https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}" \
--set env.gitlabToken="$GITLAB_TOKEN"
----

WARNING: The tokens used in this example have broad permissions. Create and use tokens with the minimum required permissions in production environments.

The GitLab parameters are required by the workflow to open and observe issues in the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/orchestrator-approvals/-/issues/1[rhdh/orchestrator-approvals issue tracker]. These issues are used to deny or approve large namespace requests.

The {product_rhdh_name} parameters are used by the workflow to send notifications to the developer using the https://backstage.io/docs/notifications/[Backstage Notifications API^]. 

After the Helm install completes, a *create-ocp-namespace-swt* SonataFlow node will appear in the Topology View.

=== Execute the Serverless Workflow

Before proceeding, logout of {product_rhdh_name} as the *{openshift_admin_user}* and login as *{rhdh_user}* using the password `{rhdh_user_password}`.

. Select the *Orchestrator* item in the left-hand menu of {product_rhdh_name}.
. Click on the *Create OpenShift Namespace* workflow.
+ 
NOTE: If the workflow isn't listed, delete the {product_rhdh_name} Pod to force a refresh of all workflows.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/orchestrator-select-workflow.png[]
. The workflow definition is shown.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/orchestrator-workflow-overview.png[]
+
The workflow itself is pretty simple. If the user requests a small or medium namespace, the workflow launches the relevant software template. It then checks the state of the software template execution and notifies the user of success or failure.
+
If a large namespace is requested, the request needs to be approved. GitLab Issues in the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/orchestrator-approvals/-/issues[orchestrator-approvals repository^] is used as a ticketing system - ServiceNow or Jira or an equivalent system could be used instead. If the request is approved, the software template is executed and the user notified. If the request is denied, the user is notified as well, but no namespace is created.
. Click on the *Run* button at the top right of the screen to start an instance of the workflow.
. You are presented with a form to enter the details of your request. Let's start with a request for a small namespace. Fill in the form as follows:
.. *Namespace name*: `{rhdh_user}-small`
.. *GitLab Host* `gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}`
.. *Requester*: `{rhdh_user}`
.. *Size*: `small`
.. *Reason*: you can leave this blank
.. *Recipients*: `user:default/{rhdh_user}`
+
NOTE: If you are logged in to {product_rhdh_name} as the `admin` user, change `user:default/{rhdh_user}` to `user:default/admin`.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/orchestrator-workflow-form.png[]
. Click on *Next* to review your request.
. Click on *Run* to start the workflow execution.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/orchestrator-workflow-run-2.png[]
. After a few seconds the status of the workflow moves to *Run completed*.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/orchestrator-workflow-run-completed.png[]
. Select the *Notifications* item in the left-hand menu.
. Notice a notification that the namespace `dev1-small` has been created.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/orchestrator-notification-1.png[]
. If you click on the notification link, you will see the component that was created as a result of the execution of the software template.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/orchestrator-component-namespace-1.png[]
. Visit the https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/k8s/cluster/projects/{rhdh_user}-small[namespace in the OpenShift Web Console^, window="console"] in your OpenShift cluster. If needed, login as `{openshift_admin_user}` / `{openshift_admin_password}`.
. Click on *Administration/ResourceQuotas* and *Administration/LimitRanges* on the left-hand side menu to see the Resource Quota and Limit Ranges defined as part of the creation of the namespace.

image:orchestrator-overview/orchestrator-workflow-small-ns-quota.png[]

=== Test the Workflow's Approval Process

. Return to {product_rhdh_name} to run another instance of the workflow, this time for a large namespace request.
. Select the *Orchestrator* item in the left-hand menu.
. Click the *Run* icon on the left of the workflow name.
. Fill in the form as follows:
.. *Namespace name*: `{rhdh_user}-large`
.. *GitLab Host* `gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}`
.. *Requester*: `{rhdh_user}`
.. *Size*: `large`
.. *Reason*: `Required for a production deployment...`
.. *Recipients*: `user:default/{rhdh_user}`
+
NOTE: If you are logged in to {product_rhdh_name} as the `admin` user, change `user:default/{rhdh_user}` to `user:default/admin`.
. Click on *Next* and *Run* to start the workflow.
. Select the *Notifications* item in the left-hand menu. After a couple of seconds you will see a notification that an issue has been created in GitLab.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/orchestrator-issue-notification.png[]
. Click on the link of the notification. This opens the issue in GitLab.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/gitlab-issue-1.png[]
. GitLab is not a ticketing system. To mimic the behavior of a ticketing system, we use labels on the issue to mark the request as approved or denied.
+
.. Make sure you are logged in into GitLab as `{gitlab_user}` / `{gitlab_user_password}`.
.. Click on the *Edit* button next to *Labels* on the right.
.. Select the *Approved* label.
.. To actually add the label, you need to click on a different area of the page, outside of the *Labels* area.
. Return to {product_rhdh_name}. After a while you should see a notification that the namespace `{rhdh_user}-large` has been created.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/notification-2.png[]
+
The workflow instance checks the status of GitLab issue every 60 seconds. When the workflow detects the *approved* label on the issue, it proceeds to create the namespace using the software template, and closes the ticket afterwards.
. You can check the https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/k8s/cluster/projects/{rhdh_user}-large[namespace in the OpenShift console^, window="console"] in your OpenShift cluster. Also notice that the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/orchestrator-approvals/-/issues/1[Issue in GitLab^, window="gitlab"] has been closed by the workflow.
+
image:orchestrator-overview/gitlab-issue-2.png[]
. Feel free to create another request for a large namespace, but this time label the issue as *denied*. In this case, you should see a notification in {product_rhdh_name} that the request was denied, and there should be no namespace created in OpenShift.

=== Conclusion

In this module you learned how the {product_rhdh_name} Orchestrator plugin, in combination with Serverless Workflow on OpenShift enables more complex workflows that go beyond what Software Templates can do. The possibilities are endless, and in this module we illustrated these possibilities with a relatively simple example that involves approval and notification as part of a developer self-service experience.
