= Trusted Software Supply Chain with {product_rhdh_name} for Production (RHADS)

== Deep dive into the Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite components

In this module we will cover the deep dive technical overview of the composite product set (Advanced Developer Suite). This is a SKU that contains an opinionated Installation
of Red Hat Developer Hub and the TSSC, TAS and TPA components described earlier. 

This is designed to provide end users with a configurable and highly secure development lifecycle from code to production.

The module will explain the mechanisms used and integrated as part of Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite, and then provide a hands-on lab showing the whole
system working end-to-end, along with tips on how to configure the components specifically for end customers/organizations.
