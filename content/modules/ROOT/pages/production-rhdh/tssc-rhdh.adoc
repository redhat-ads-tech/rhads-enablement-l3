= RHADS End-to-End: Production-Ready Development Lifecycle

In this module we will cover the deep dive technical overview of the composite product set *Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite*. This is a SKU that contains an opinionated Installation
of Red Hat Developer Hub, Trusted Artifact Signer (TAS) and Trusted Profile Analyzer (TPA) components described earlier, along with pipelines for a trusted software supply chain (TSSC).

This is designed to provide end users with a configurable and highly secure development lifecycle from code to production.

The module will explain the mechanisms used and integrated as part of Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite, and then provide a hands-on lab showing the whole
system working end-to-end, along with tips on how to configure the components specifically for end customers/organizations.
