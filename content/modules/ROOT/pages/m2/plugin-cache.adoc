= Enable Dynamic Plugin Caching

You might have noticed that the *install-dynamic-plugins* container can take a few minutes to run. Dynamic plugin caching improves the startup performance and reliability of your {product_rhdh_name} deployment by storing plugin packages in a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/[persistent volume^]. This provides several benefits:

* *Faster deployments*: Plugins are cached locally and don't need to be downloaded when pods start
* *Reduced bandwidth consumption*: Plugin packages are only downloaded once and reused across deployments  
* *Improved reliability*: Reduces dependency on external registries during pod startup
* *Better resource utilization*: Reduces CPU and memory usage during plugin installation by avoiding repeated downloads

Without dynamic plugin caching, the {product_rhdh_name} downloads and installs plugins fresh with each pod restart. This process can be slow and bandwidth-intensive, especially in environments with many plugins and frequent deployments.

== Create a PersistentVolumeClaim

First, create a PersistentVolumeClaim that will store the cached plugin packages. This PVC will be mounted into the {product_rhdh_name} pods to provide persistent storage for downloaded plugins.

. Navigate to *Storage > PersistentVolumeClaims* in the OpenShift Web Console.
. Ensure the `{m2_rhdh_project}` project is selected.
. Click the *Create PersistentVolumeClaim* button and select *With Form*.
. Use the following settings:
+
* *StorageClass*: Use the default value 
* *Name*:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
dynamic-plugins-root
----
* *Access mode*: Single-user RWO
* *Size*: 5Gi
* *Volume mode*: Filesystem
+

. Click *Create* to create the PersistentVolumeClaim.

The 5GiB storage allocation provides sufficient space for caching multiple plugins while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. The `ReadWriteOnce` access mode is appropriate since the cache will be accessed by a single {product_rhdh_name} pod at a time.

== Patch the {product_rhdh_name} CR

Next, update your Backstage Custom Resource to mount a volume. This configuration uses the {product_rhdh_name} Operator's patch functionality to modify the underlying Deployment.

. Navigate to *Operators > Installed Operators* in the OpenShift Web Console.

. Click on *{product_rhdh_name}*.
. Select the *Backstage* tab, then click on your `{m2_rhdh_instance}` instance.
. Click the *YAML* tab to edit the resource.
. Add the following `deployment.patch` configuration to your Backstage CR's `spec` field:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
spec:
  # Add this deployment patch configuration
  deployment:
    patch:
      spec:
        template:
          spec:
            volumes:
              - $patch: replace
                name: dynamic-plugins-root
                persistentVolumeClaim:
                  claimName: dynamic-plugins-root
----
+
[WARNING]
====
Do not remove or overwrite existing sections. Only add the new `deployment` field to the existing `spec` with other the fields inside `spec`.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
The `$patch: replace` directive tells the operator to replace the existing `dynamic-plugins-root` volume (which is an https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir[emptyDir^] by default) with a PersistentVolumeClaim-backed volume. This ensures that plugin cache data persists across pod restarts.
====
. Click *Save* to apply the changes.

== Verify Plugin Cache Configuration

After updating the Backstage CR, a new pod will be created with the persistent volume mounted for plugin caching.

. Navigate to *Workloads > Pods* and select the latest Backstage pod.
. Click the *Details* tab and scroll down to the *Volumes* section.
. Verify that the `dynamic-plugins-root` volume shows a *PersistentVolumeClaim* source instead of *EmptyDir*.
. Select the *Events* tab and you'll notice an event that references `AttachVolume.Attach` for your new volume.
+

Next, you'll observe just how much faster a new pod starts with plugin caching enabled.

. Wait for the new deployment's `backstage-backend` container to start.
. Return to the *Workloads > Pods* list and locate the `backstage-rhdh` pod.
. Click the three dots to the right of the table and delete the pod - a new pod will immediately be created to replace the missing Backstage pod.
+
image::setup-rhdh/plugin-cache-delete-pod.png[]
. Visit the logs for the new pod and you'll find that the *install-dynamic-plugins* container reports that it's not downloading previously installed plugins.

Did you notice how much faster the plugin installation process has become?

With dynamic plugin caching enabled, subsequent deployments will continue to use cached plugin packages, significantly improving startup performance and reducing external dependencies during pod initialization.
