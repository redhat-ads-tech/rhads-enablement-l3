= Install and Configure {product_rhdh_name}

== Installation Requirements

This guide follows an Operator-based installation method for {product_rhdh_name}. A Helm-based installation option is also available, but is outside the scope of this module.

Refer to the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/[latest {product_rhdh_name} documentation^] for up-to-date installation requirements.

For {product_rhdh_name} version {product_rhdh_version}, the following hardware resources are recommended:

* 7 vCPU
* 26 GiB Memory
* 23 GiB Storage

OpenShift versions 4.16 through 4.19 are supported. Visit the https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/developerhub[{product_rhdh_name} Life Cycle page^] for the latest information.

== Operator Install & Verification

Your environment has been preconfigured with the {product_rhdh_name} Operator preinstalled. You'll verify that the Operator is installed and running in this section.

=== Access OperatorHub and Installed Operators

. Log in to the {openshift_console_url}[OpenShift Web Console^] using the following credentials:
    * Username: `{openshift_admin_user}`
    * Password: `{openshift_admin_password}`
. Dismiss any popups that appear.
+
image::setup-rhdh/select-cluster.png[]
. If the *Developer* perspective is enabled, switch to the *Administrator* perspective using the *Perspective Switcher* in the top-left of the UI.
. Expand *Operators* section in the side menu and click the *Installed Operators* link.

You're now viewing the operators that have been preinstalled in your environment.

=== Confirm {product_rhdh_name} Operator is Installed

. Ensure *All projects* is selected in the *Project* selector - https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/building-operators/golang/operator-scope/[cluster-scoped^] operators will be listed.
. Select *{product_rhdh_name}* from the listed operators.

[WARNING]
====
Contact a lab administrator if the {product_rhdh_name} Operator is not listed.

== Create a {product_rhdh_name} Instance

=== The Backstage Custom Resource

The {product_rhdh_name} Operator provides a Backstage https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom Resource Definition (CRD)^] for Kubernetes. This CRD is used to provision new instances of {product_rhdh_name} on OpenShift clusters.

A minimal Backstage CR resembles the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha4
kind: Backstage
metadata:
  name: my-rhdh-instance
spec:
  # define application specific configurations, e.g create an OpenShift Route
  application:
    route:
      enabled: true
  # Provision a Postgres database for storage. In production scenarios, it's
  # recommended to use a Postgres instance that's managed and configured for HA
  database:
    enableLocalDb: true
```

Once this CR is applied to the OpenShift cluster, the {product_rhdh_name} Operator will provision a new instance of {product_rhdh_name} in the namespace where the CR was created.

[WARNING]
====
Before creating a Backstage CR, we need to satisfy some prerequisites. So don't apply that YAML to your environment just yet!
====

=== Create a Project/Namespace

. Visit the {openshift_console_url}[OpenShift Web Console^].
. Switch to the *Administrator* perspective using the *Perspective Switcher* in the top-left of the UI.
. Navigate to *Home > Projects*, then click the *Create project* button. 
+
image::setup-rhdh/create-project.png[]
. Enter the name `{m2_rhdh_project}` in the popup that appears, then click *Create*.

You'll use this project throughout this module - it's essential that you use the name *{m2_rhdh_project}* or subsequent exercises won't work as expected.

=== Defining a Backstage Configuration

As mentioned earlier, {product_rhdh_name} is based on the Backstage CNCF project. Backstage requires an https://backstage.io/docs/conf/[app-config.yaml^] to define its configuration. The *app-config.yaml* can be mounted as a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/[volume^] in Backstage Pods that are created by the {product_rhdh_name} Operator.

In this section you'll create a basic Backstage configuration and store it as a ConfigMap on OpenShift in the `{m2_rhdh_project}` namespace.

. Select *Workloads > ConfigMaps* using the side navigation.
. Ensure that the *{m2_rhdh_project}* project is selected in the project selector.
. Click the *Create ConfigMap* button on the *ConfigMaps* screen.
+
image::setup-rhdh/create-rhdh-configmap.png[]
. Switch to the *YAML view*, delete the existing content, then paste the following into the editor:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {m2_rhdh_cm_name}
  namespace: {m2_rhdh_project}
data:
  app-config.yaml: |
    app:
      title: Red Hat Developer Hub

    # Enable guest sign-in without user validation. This configuration
    # is unsafe - only use it for testing when Developer Hub is not
    # connected to upstream sources of data!
    auth:
      providers:
        guest:
          dangerouslyAllowOutsideDevelopment: true
----
. Click *Create* to create the ConfigMap containing your *app-config.yaml*.

[NOTE]
====
The URL referenced in the ConfigMap is determined by combining the Backstage CR name with "backstage" and the namespace name. For example, your namespace is `{m2_rhdh_project}` and the Backstage CR will be named `{m2_rhdh_instance}`, so the URL is https://{m2_rhdh_instance}-backstage-{m2_rhdh_project}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}.
====

=== Deploy a {product_rhdh_name} Instance

. Click the plus (`+`) icon in the top-right corner of the OpenShift Web Console, then select the *Import YAML* option.
. Paste the following YAML into the editor:
+
[source,yaml,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: rhdh.redhat.com/v1alpha4
kind: Backstage
metadata:
  name: {m2_rhdh_instance}
  namespace: {m2_rhdh_project}
spec:
  application:
    appConfig:
      mountPath: /opt/app-root/src
      # This instructs the operator to mount the ConfigMap
      # that you created into the Backstage Pods
      configMaps:
        - name: {m2_rhdh_cm_name}
    route:
      enabled: true
  database:
    enableLocalDb: true
----
. Click *Create*. You will be redirected to a screen showing your new Backstage CR.
+
image::setup-rhdh/backstage-cr.png[]

This Backstage CR will be detected by the {product_rhdh_name} Operator. The Operator will deploy Postgres and Backstage Pods in the `{m2_rhdh_project}` namespace. Verify the status of the Pods by visiting *Workloads > Pods* and checking that both Pods are marked as running and ready - this will take a minute or two.

NOTE: If you don't see the expected Pods, make sure to select the *{m2_rhdh_project}* in the *Project* dropdown.

image::setup-rhdh/backstage-pods.png[]

=== Visit your {product_rhdh_name} Instance

You can access your instance of {product_rhdh_name} using a https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.19/html-single/networking_overview/index#nw-understanding-networking-routes-ingress_understanding-networking[Route^] that was created by the Operator.

. Select *Networking > Routes* in the side menu of the OpenShift Web Console.
. Ensure that the *{m2_rhdh_project}* project is selected in the project selector.
. Click the URL in the *Location* column on the *Routes* page. The {product_rhdh_name} sign-in page will appear.
+
NOTE: If an *Application is not available* message is displayed when you click the Location, wait another minute. This simply means the Pod readiness check has not passed yet, but will soon.
+
image::setup-rhdh/backstage-route.png[]
. Select the *Guest* sign-in option. You'll automatically be logged in as a *Guest* user, and the home page will be displayed.

== Conclusion

Nice work! You deployed an instance of {product_rhdh_name} with a minimal *app-config.yaml*. 

An internal developer portal is only valuable when it has been connected to sources of data and configured with templates. In the following sections you'll learn how to connect {product_rhdh_name} to:

* Source Control (GitLab in this environment)
* Single Sign-On (Keycloak in this environment)
* Continuous Delivery (Argo CD in this environment)

Additionally, you'll learn how to:

* Safely include sensitive information in your *app-config.yaml* using Secrets
* Manage plugins and plugin configuration
* Enable role-based access control (RBAC)
