= AI Platform Engineering: Using software templates to provide the tools to build an AI Agent with Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite

== Objectives 
Using a pre-existing software template, you will create a new resource in Red Hat Developer Hub. This resource will serve as a blank template for AI Engineers to build an AI agent. As part of the Platform Engineering team, you will set up this resource with all necessary Kubernetes manifests, including the trusted software supply chain, deployments, and application promotion. In the next lab, AI Engineers will add their application source code to this new resource, integrating it into the software development lifecycle.

== Scenario 
You are part of the AI Platform Engineering team, responsible for providing the tools and best practices—aligned with your organization's guidelines—for the AI team to build an AI agent in OpenShift.

Let's get started.

== Understanding software templates

Software templates can build, deploy, and promote any application that runs in a container or as a Kubernetes component. They ensure development teams start with established best practices and organizational guidelines, putting guardrails and compliance in place before the application ever runs on the cluster.

== About pre-defined software templates

Pre-defined software templates are included with the RHADS installation. They provide recipes users can leverage to start bringing applications into OpenShift. These templates offer a starting point and reference for building applications using the Trusted Software Supply Chain (TSSC). They are not intended for production use; customers can add their own configurations on top of these templates by following the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_trusted_application_pipeline/latest/html/customizing_red_hat_trusted_application_pipeline/index[Customizing Red Hat Trusted Application Pipeline documentation^].

== Create the component

Let's create a new component from the pre-existing Software Template in Red Hat Developer Hub.

* Click on *catalog*:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-catalogicon.png[width=30%]

* Next, click on *Self-service*:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-selfservice.png[width=30%]

Then select the software template: Python - Trusted Application Pipeline

* Click on *Choose*

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-catalog-python.png[width=60%]

Follow the steps to create the component in Red Hat Developer Hub, adding the following input data for each section.

=== Application Information

Enter the following data:

* *Name: ai-agent*

* *Owner: Select the user: user1 from the dropdown:*

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-python-user.png[width=60%]

* *Click on *Next*

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-python.png[width=100%]

=== Application Repository Information

Change only the following fields:

* *Host Type: GitLab*

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-gitselection.png[width=30%]

* *Repository Name: ai-agent*

* *Repository Owner: rhdh*

* *Repository Server: gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}*

Your screen should look similar to this:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-python2.png[width=100%]

Keep Repository Default Branch and CI Provider with the default values.

*Note:* The GitLab URL may differ, as the cluster domain will vary.

* Click on *Next*

=== Deployment Information

Change only the following inputs:

* *Image Registry: quay-{guid}.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}*

* *Image Organization: tssc*

* *Image Name: ai-agent*

Your screen should look similar to this:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-python3.png[width=100%]

Keep Deployment Namespace with the default value.

=== Click on Review

Your screen should look similar to this:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-python4.png[width=100%]

Ensure your information matches the image, except for the cluster domain.

=== Click on the Create button

Red Hat Developer Hub will run the tasks defined in the *template.yaml* file and other manifests. Once finished, all steps will appear in green.

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-python5.png[width=100%]

Next, you will explore the application source code.

*Congratulations!* You now have a resource available for the AI team to start building their application.

== Exploring the software template

In this section, you will review what was created and learn how to understand these configurations.

Two repositories were created, both required to build and deploy the application:

* *Source Repository*: Contains pipelines that validate pull requests, ensuring image updates are safe before promoting applications to the next environment (e.g., from staging to production).

* *GitOps Repository*: Represents the AI application, which currently contains only a sample app. AI Engineers will use this repository to add the AI Agent.

Learn more about these templates at https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_trusted_application_pipeline/latest/html/customizing_red_hat_trusted_application_pipeline/customizing-sample-pipelines_default[Customizing Sample Pipelines^].

== Adding more configurations

You have received new requests from the AI Engineering team:

. Update the *dev.yaml* file with application configurations. 
. Integrate Red Hat Developer Hub with *Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces*. 
. Configure the application to use *environment variables* to connect to an AI model and an API. 
. Create a *GitLab webhook* to trigger the OpenShift Pipelines.

As a Platform Engineer, you must update the software templates or components to manage custom configurations. In this case, you will apply these configurations directly to the newly created component. Let's work on these requests!

=== 1- Update the dev.yaml file

In this section, you will replace the *whole content* of the dev.yaml file.

* Go to the *GitLab source code* repository:

** On the same screen, click on *Source Repository* 

** Or  use the following URL, link:{gitlab_url}/rhdh/ai-agent[GitLab AI Agent,window='_blank'].

* Log in to GitLab using your credentials:

** Click on *Sign in*:

* Commit your changes:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-commit.png[width=60%]

* Verify the link was added to the component:

** Go back to {rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/ai-agent/[Red Hat Developer Hub UI - AI Agent^]

** You should see a new link in the component's overview:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhdh-devspaces-click.png[width=100%]

* *Note:*  Do not click the link. You will use Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces in the next lab as an AI Engineer.

=== Create the webhook 

Webhooks are not part of the pre-defined software templates, but they are required to trigger pipelines when the source code changes. Now, create a webhook in the source code repository in GitLab.

* Go to the source code repository or access it directly: link:{gitlab_url}/rhdh/ai-agent[GitLab AI Agent,window='_blank']

* Click *Settings > Webhooks*

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-webhook.png[width=80%]

* Click *Add new webhook* 

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-webhook-new.png[width=100%]

* Copy the URL and paste it in the URL field.

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
https://pipelines-as-code-controller-openshift-pipelines.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
----

* In the *Trigger* section, select the following:
* Push events
* Tag Push events
* Comments

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-webhook-config.png[width=100%]

* Scroll to the bottom and click *Add webhook*.

+
image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-add-webhook.png[width=100%]

Next, you will test the webhook from this screen to ensure it works.

=== Test the webhook

* On the *Webhooks* screen, click *Test* and select *Push events*.

+
image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-webhook-test.png[width=100%]

* This will trigger the pipeline.

=== Explore the Pipeline

** Go back to {rhdh_url}/catalog/default/component/ai-agent/[Red Hat Developer Hub UI - AI Agent^]

** Click the *CI* tab.

+
image:rhads-ai/rhads/rhads-tssc.png[width=100%]

*Note:* The pipeline will take a few minutes to complete all steps.

The AI agent will be built using the Trusted Software Supply Chain (TSSC) provided by Red Hat Advanced Developer Suite. This ensures all security best practices and organizational guardrails are in place *before* development begins. As a best practice, this applies a shift-left security approach to all development.

The TSSC pipeline uses OpenShift Pipelines to build a container image, generate an SBOM, and push both to Red Hat Quay. Subsequent tasks use the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (ACS) *roxctl* CLI: *acs-image-check* verifies the image signature against security policies, and *acs-image-scan* identifies vulnerabilities. Red Hat Quay acts as the secure registry, storing the signed images, SBOMs, and metadata.

To learn more, review xref:tssc-overview.adoc[Module 11: Trusted Software Supply Chain].

*Note:* If you face a 500 error during the build container image step, restart the *quay-quay-app.* pods (2 pods) in the *quay-enterprise* namespace.


=== Add environment variables

* Go to the AI Agent GitOps repository's *deployment.yaml*: link:{gitlab_url}/rhdh/ai-agent-gitops/-/blob/main/components/ai-agent/base/deployment.yaml[ai-agent-gitops deployment.yaml,window='_blank'].

* Click *Edit*, then *Edit Single File*.

+
image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-open.png[width=100%]

* At line 52, paste the new code. This adds integrations for LLM models (name, URL, API key) and the Tavily API, which will be used as an AI Agent tool. *Ensure you are not replacing the current content.*

[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
        - name: LLM_API_BASE_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: ai-agent-secrets-llm
              key: LLM_API_BASE_URL
        - name: TAVILY_API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: ai-agent-secrets-tavily
              key: TAVILY_API_KEY
        - name: LLM_API_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: ai-agent-secrets-llm
              key: LLM_API_KEY

----

Your file should look like this. *Ensure the indentation is correct*:

image:rhads-ai/rhads/gitlab-commit.png[width=60%]

*Note:* In the next lab, the developer will create the secret with the keys. This is not a recommended practice, but it is done for this lab to avoid sharing private keys in a public repository.

Great job! You have successfully built the tools for the AI Engineering team to start building the AI Agent.
